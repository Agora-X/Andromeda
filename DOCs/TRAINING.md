# Andromeda Model Training Standard Operating Procedure

This document provides a standard operating procedure (SOP) for training the Andromeda model. The SOP includes step-by-step instructions on how to train the model end-to-end using the provided code.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the training, make sure you have the following:

1. Hugging Face API Key: Obtain an API key from the Hugging Face website (https://huggingface.co).
2. Python Environment: Set up a Python environment with the required dependencies and packages.

## Step 1: Dataset Preparation

The training script requires a dataset to train the Andromeda model. The dataset should be in the Falcon format, which includes the following data fields:

- `content`: The processed and cleaned text contained in the page.
- `url`: The URL of the webpage crawled to produce the sample.
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of when the webpage was crawled by CommonCrawl.
- `dump`: The CommonCrawl dump the sample is a part of.
- `segment`: The CommonCrawl segment the sample is a part of.
- `image_urls`: A list of elements in the format `[image_url, image_alt_text]` for all the images found in the content of the sample.

Follow these steps to prepare the dataset:

1. Create a Python script named `build_dataset.py`.
2. Copy the provided code for `build_dataset.py`.
3. Replace `YOUR HUGGINGFACE API KEY` in the `CFG` class with your actual Hugging Face API key.
4. Save the script.

To run the dataset preparation script, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
python build_dataset.py --hf_account YOUR_HF_ACCOUNT_NAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
```

The script will tokenize and process the dataset using the specified tokenizer and push it to the Hugging Face Hub using your API key.

## Step 2: Model Definition

The Andromeda model is defined in the `model.py` script. This script includes the model architecture and configuration. No changes are required in this script unless you want to modify the model architecture.

## Step 3: Distributed Training

To train the Andromeda model using distributed training, follow these steps:

1. Create a Python script named `train_distributed.py`.
2. Copy the provided code for `train_distributed.py`.
3. Replace `YOUR_OUTPUT_DIR` in the `CFG` class with the desired output directory path.
4. Replace `YOUR_ENTITY_NAME` in the `CFG` class with your desired entity name for logging.
5. Save the script.

To start the training, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
python train_distributed.py
```

The training script will automatically load the dataset, initialize the model, and begin the training process. The script uses techniques such as gradient accumulation, mixed precision, and activation checkpointing to optimize the training process. The progress will be displayed in the console, and the trained model will be saved in the specified output directory.

## Conclusion

This SOP provides a guide for training the Andromeda model end-to-end. By following the steps outlined in this document, you will be able to prepare the dataset, define the model, and perform distributed training. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different configurations to achieve the desired results.
